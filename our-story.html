                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>At Eat Fit Food, we pride ourselves on our nutritious and wholesome meals that are delivered conveniently to your door. Using the finest quality produce, including locally farmed and ethically sourced meat and fish, the freshness of our meals is guaranteed.</p>
                <p>At just 22-years-old, Bianca Monley founded Eat Fit Food in 2002, after identifying a gap in the food market in Sydney. From then on, the Eat Fit Food love spread far and wide, with kitchens in both Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
                <p>We are the pioneers in delivering fresh healthy meals exactly “as mother nature intended” and have quality wholefoods at our core. Delivering premium meals to time-poor, health-conscious families, we enjoy educating Australians on how to lead healthier, more vibrant lives.</p>
                <p>With programs for meat-lovers, vegetarians and vegans, and a variety of gluten-free and dairy-free meals, we accommodate for a variety of needs. Whether you’re trying to lose weight, maintain or enjoy the convenience of a kitchen-free week, we have something for you.</p>
                <p>As the saying goes, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. Our dietitian-approved meals will eliminate harmful toxins within your body and generate wellness, allowing your newly found inner health and beauty to radiate on the outside too.</p>
                <p>Want to be part of the Eat Fit Food journey? You can purchase individual meals, or choose from our 5, 10 and 20 day fully-inclusive programs saving you time, energy and money.</p>
